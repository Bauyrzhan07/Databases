a)What are the main phases in the database design? What is done on each development phase?
1.The first phase is characterizing the data needs to users. On this phase database developer collects all requirements.
2.The second phase is to choose the data model which will be used in developing in database application. In this phase
the database developer translates all the requirements collected in the first phase into the conceptual schema.
3.Then the designer should review the scheme whether it meets to functional requirements.
4.The last phase of designing the database consists of two parts:logical-design phase and physical design phase. In the
former phase the designer maps the conceptual schema into relational schema. In the latter phase designer specifies
physical features of database, such as file organization and choice of index structures.
b)The ER(Entity Relation) data model is one of the database designs. It consists of three basic concepts:entity sets,relation
sets,attributes.
